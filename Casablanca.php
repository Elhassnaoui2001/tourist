                            <h2 class="mb-3">General information about Casablanca</h2>
                            <p>Casablanca, the vibrant metropolis of Morocco, offers a captivating blend of 
                                historical landmarks that showcase the city's rich heritage. One of the iconic 
                                sites that visitors should not miss is the magnificent Hassan II Mosque. 
                                Standing as a testament to both faith and architectural brilliance, this mosque
                                 is adorned with intricate details and boasts breathtaking ocean views. Another 
                                 notable historical monument is the Old Medina, where narrow alleys wind their 
                                 way through bustling markets, allowing travelers to immerse themselves in the 
                                 city's authentic charm. The Casablanca Cathedral, a remnant of the colonial era,
                                  stands as an architectural gem with its neo-Gothic design and stained glass windows.
                                   For those seeking a glimpse into the city's judicial past, a visit to the Mahkama du Pacha,
                                    a beautifully restored courthouse, offers a captivating experience. As you explore 
                                    its ornate interiors, you'll be transported to a bygone era of grandeur. 
                                    These historical landmarks, along with others like Villa des Arts, Mohammed V Square, 
                                    and the picturesque Corniche, contribute to Casablanca's allure, inviting visitors to 
                                    delve into its intriguing past while embracing its vibrant present.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            There are a few interesting attractions to discover in the city itself, with almost everything revolving around films and film productions. However, also close to Ouarzazate are real highlights to discover, such as the world-famous UNESCO World Heritage Site Ait-Ben-Haddou. Here are the best things to do when you visit Ouarzazate:

                            <h4 class="mb-3">Hassan II Mosque</h4>
                            <img class="img-fluid w-100" src="img/mosquee-hassan-II.jpg">
                            <p>This magnificent mosque is not only a place of worship but also an architectural masterpiece. It is one of the largest and most beautiful mosques in the world. Admire its meticulous design, exquisite details, and impressive waterfront location. A guided tour will allow you to explore the grand prayer hall, stunning tiles, and breathtaking views.
                            This opulent mosque, built at enormous expense, is set on an outcrop jutting over the ocean with a 210m-tall minaret that's a city landmark. It's a showcase of the finest Moroccan artisanship: hand-carved stone and wood, intricate marble flooring and inlay, gilded cedar ceilings and exquisite zellige (geometric mosaic tilework) abound. It's one of two Moroccan mosques open to non-Muslims; multilanguage guided tours are conducted outside prayer times for modestly clad visitors. There’s also a small museum showcasing the craftwork involved.

One of the largest mosques in Africa, it can hold 105,000 worshippers – 25,000 inside, the rest on the outside courtyards. Built and partially funded by King Hassan II (the remaining funds were gathered through a somewhat controversial public subscription process), the mosque complex was designed by French architect Michel Pinseau, took six years to build and was completed in 1993.

                                <h4 class="mb-3">Old Medina</h4>
                            <img class="img-fluid w-100" src="img/oldmdinacasa.webp">
                            <p>Immerse yourself in the past as you wander through the narrow, winding alleys of Casablanca's Old Medina. Although smaller than other medinas in Morocco, it retains its authentic charm and offers a glimpse into traditional Moroccan life. Explore bustling markets, discover local craftsmanship, and savor the flavors of traditional cuisine.
                            While the 18th century Medina of Casablanca is far eclipsed by its counterparts across the country, it is by no means a skippable attraction. In contrary to other Medinas in Morocco, the city’s historic district is devoid of any tourist-oriented sites and facilities. In fact, foreign visitors, especially the camera-armed ones, are greeted with a great deal of suspicion. This unwelcoming attitude should not deter you from going there, but rather be taken into account upon visit. Therefore, asking people for a permission before taking photos of them or their property is highly recommended.
